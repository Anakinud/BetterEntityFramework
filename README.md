# BetterEntityFramework

As a response to [my blog post], this is a library demonstrating how projects can more cleanly work with Entity Framework without imposing artificial restrictions that limit the ability of the application to grow and always use the most efficient queries it needs. This is mostly an excercise on learning your tools and getting comfortable with them, only changing what needs changed, and ultimately trusting that teams of highly paid smart people might actually know what they're doing. In case you found this prematurely, I'm writing a follow up blog that will explain the code here. Stay tuned.
